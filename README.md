# Convolutional-AutoEncoder-Classifier
 A modification of the Convolutional AutoEncoder that has a Classifier attached to it.
 Based on work by:

 [https://github.com/axkoenig/autoencoder](https://github.com/axkoenig/autoencoder)
 
 
Although MNIST classification can even be done through MLP networks, By using the output of the encoder portion of an AutoEncoder, weâ€™d be able to classify more complex images after transfer learning.

The AutoEncoder section of this project achieved a 96% reduction in size when the output of the encoder is compared against the original MNIST file.

The classifier portion of this project achieved a 88% accuracy off the outputs of the encoder.
